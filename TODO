# TODO

- Publish schema
- Move geo files from elections package into here ...
- Stop using a static candidates crosswalk that has to be rebuilt from observed candidate names with the package
- Could look for normalizing transformations file in current working directory; then use defaults


- MA, WI and CT are pulling in county subdivisions file from ../geo
- write files (csv and feather)
- streamline merging EAVs data
- add parties:
      party == 'REP/AI' ~ 'republican/american independence',
      party == 'PF' ~ 'Peace and Freedom',
- add candidates:
  dd[candidate == "Feegbeh and O'Brien", candidate := 'William Feegbeh']
  dd[candidate == "Johnson and Weld", candidate := 'Gary Johnson']
  dd[candidate == "Kotlikoff and Leamer", candidate := 'Laurence Kotlikoff']
  dd[candidate == "Mcmullin and Johnson", candidate := 'Evan McMullin']
  dd[candidate == "Moorehead and Lilly", candidate := 'Monica Moorehead']
  dd[candidate == "Schoenke and Mitchel", candidate := 'Marshall Schoenke']
- move candidate patterns and replacements to data file

# name_cols = c('saluation', 'first_name', 'middle_name', 'last_name', 'suffix', 'full_name')
# d[, c('saluation', 'first_name', 'middle_name', 'last_name', 'suffix', 'full_name') := parse_names(candidate)]
